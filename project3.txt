Working App: Grocery Food App
1) Allows you to look at food ingredients in popular products (USDA API)
2) Allows you to look at recall information (FDA API).
3) Allows you to create shopping lists and save to server (authentication using bcrypt)

After MVP:
4) Allows you to search for recipes (Edamam API?)
5) Allows you to scan for barcodes?
6) Create shared community of comments and recipes?

Technologies:
React or Angular
bcrypt
node
lodash?
FDA/USDA APIs
other APIs?

To-do: (* indicates Minimal Viable Product)
1) Determine different endpoints:
-login page*
-sign up page*
-home page*
-search recipe page
-search food ingredients page*
-search for latest recalls in food products*
-create shopping lists*
-create receipe list
-search for shared recipes 

2) Determine structure
-research Angular?
-determine database structure (MySQL or Mongo)
-APIs: need food ingredients (USDA), need food safety (FDA), need recipes (Edamam or similar?)

3) Layout
-use of bootstrap, materalize, or other CSS library?
-background images
-INTEGRATION WITH REACT/ANGULAR!!!

4) Start Build: 2 parts:
backend: server --> controller (API routes with GET/POST) --> model (ORM functions)

frontend: intracommunication within client pages (i.e. parent/child class relationships, states, props) <-- server
